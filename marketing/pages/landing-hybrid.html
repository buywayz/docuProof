          docuProof lets you create independent, tamper-evident proof for any file,
          anchored on the Bitcoin blockchain. Your file never leaves your device —
          but your proof lives on a public, time-ordered ledger.

              A clause gets quietly edited before a dispute. You <em>remember</em> what it said.

          <h3>Do you ever upload or keep my file?</h3>
          <p>
            No. The hash is computed locally in your browser. docuProof only sees the hash
            and the metadata you choose to send (like a file name or display name).

        <article class="m-faq-item">
          <h3>Is this a legal notary service?</h3>
          <p>
            No. docuProof is a technical proof-of-existence tool, not a legal notary.
            It strengthens your evidence with a public, independently verifiable timestamp
            on the Bitcoin blockchain. How that is treated legally depends on your context.

        </article>

        <article class="m-faq-item">
          <h3>Why the Bitcoin blockchain specifically?</h3>
          <p>
            The Bitcoin blockchain is globally replicated, hard to rewrite, and optimized
            for ordered, time-linked transactions. That makes it a strong base layer for
            timestamping — independent of any single company, including us.

        <article class="m-faq-item">
          <h3>What if docuProof goes away?</h3>
          <p>
            Your original file plus your OpenTimestamps receipt are enough. You can verify
            them using open-source tools against the Bitcoin blockchain without going
            through docuProof.
