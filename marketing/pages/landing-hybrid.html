            <strong>“We actually had that idea first.”</strong><br>
            You send a proposal, deck, or manuscript. Later, a client or competitor ships something
            suspiciously close. With a timestamped proof, you can quietly show your version existed earlier.
            <span class="m-inline-cta">→ Timestamp before you share.</span>

            <strong>“That’s not what the document said.”</strong><br>
            A scope, policy, or agreement is edited after the fact.
            Memory is fuzzy; PDFs are easy to change. A timestamp on the Bitcoin blockchain
            lets you prove what the file looked like on a specific date.
            <span class="m-inline-cta">→ Timestamp before you negotiate.</span>

            <strong>“These photos could have been faked.”</strong><br>
            Condition photos, incident evidence, before/after work.
            In a dispute, someone will question authenticity. A blockchain timestamp turns
            “I promise” into “Here’s independent proof this existed then.”
