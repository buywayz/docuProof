        <h2>Questions you probably have</h2>

          The full FAQ lives on the start page. Here are the big ones.

      </div>

      <div class="m-faq-grid">
        <article class="m-faq-item">
          <h3>Do you ever see or store my file?</h3>
          <p>
            No. docuProof computes a SHA-256 hash locally in your browser. Only that hash and your chosen labels
            (file name, display name, email) are sent to the backend.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="m-faq-item">
          <h3>Is this a legal notary service?</h3>
          <p>
            No. docuProof is a technical proof-of-existence tool, not a notary. It gives you a cryptographic timestamp on your content;
            your legal position still depends on your jurisdiction and context.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="m-faq-item">
          <h3>What happens if docuProof disappears?</h3>
          <p>
            Your <code>.ots</code> receipt and original file are enough. You can use the open-source OpenTimestamps tools
            to verify that the hash existed before the Bitcoin block it was anchored into.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="m-faq-item">
          <h3>Can I roll this out to clients or a team?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. The current UI works fine as a “lightweight proof terminal” for small teams and client work.
            Longer-term, you can treat this as a reference design for a deeper integration.
