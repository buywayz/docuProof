        <div class="m-audience-body">
          You send a proposal, deck, or manuscript. Weeks later, a client or competitor launches
          something uncannily close. With a timestamped proof, you can quietly show your version
          existed earlier — independently anchored on the Bitcoin blockchain.<br>

        <div class="m-audience-body">
          A scope, work order, or policy is edited after the fact. Memory is fuzzy; PDFs are easy to change.
          Timestamping the original file locks in what it looked like on that date, giving you a neutral
          reference point when stories diverge.<br>

          Condition photos, before/after work, incident evidence — in a dispute, someone will question
          authenticity. A blockchain timestamp turns “trust me” into independently verifiable proof
          that the image existed then, exactly as shown.<br>
